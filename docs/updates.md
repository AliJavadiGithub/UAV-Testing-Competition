# Announcements and Updates

## Important Updates (8.12.2023)

- **Due to multiple requests, we are implementing a grace period. You can update your submissions until 10.12.2023 (AoE).**
- **In the meantime, we are checking if we can run and evaluate your submitted codes. We will let you know if we got problems and ask for an update if needed.**
- **A small update to [testcase.py](https://github.com/skhatiri/UAV-Testing-Competition/commit/50e3e983ef98f1be4a550922fc23b68b35740a4b) will also help some of you that had problems integrating latest changes.**
- **To easily set the simulation timeout, you can use the following command to run your test generator:**

  `SIMULATION_TIMEOUT=300 python3 cli.py generate case_studies/mission1.yaml 100`

## Important Updates (4.12.2023)

- **Recent [Aerialist update](https://github.com/skhatiri/Aerialist/pull/14) lets you set a timeout period for simulations. After timeout is reached, simulation is aborted and you can access the flight log and plot of the unfinished test.**
- **This can help with identifying the test cases that take too much time to finish, and before you were not able to check the logs to understand why.**
